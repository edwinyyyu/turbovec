// Processes pairs of consecutive BLOCK=32 blocks per inner-loop iteration,
// loading the two 32-byte code regions (which are NOT adjacent in the blocked
// layout — they're separated by the rest of block b's groups) into a single
// 512-bit register via `_mm512_inserti64x4`. The lane-local
// `_mm512_shuffle_epi8` then performs both blocks' lookups in one instruction
// pair (one for hi nibbles, one for lo). Re-uses the existing AVX2 pack
// layout and the existing 32-byte LUT format unchanged — the LUT is
// `_mm512_broadcast_i64x4`'d so both 256-bit halves see the same shuffle table.
//
// The lower 256 bits of each zmm accumulator hold block b's state and the
// upper 256 bits hold block b+1's. Periodically (every FLUSH_EVERY groups,
// to keep the u16 lane sums from overflowing) both halves are extracted
// into `__m256i` locals and folded into per-query f32 accumulators via
// `avx2_batch_flush_to_fa`; after the last batch a final
// `avx2_post_flush_heap_update` does the top-k heap insertion.
//
// Tail (when `n_blocks` is odd) processes the final unpaired block via an
// inlined AVX2 inner-loop body at the end. Avoids any masked AVX-512 logic.
