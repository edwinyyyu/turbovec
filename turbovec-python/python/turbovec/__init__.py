#: Default batch slice size for the interruptible-chunking wrappers over
#: ``search`` / ``add`` / ``add_with_ids`` (issue #216). Batches with more
#: rows than this are processed one slice at a time so a queued Ctrl-C is
#: serviced between slices instead of at the end of the call. Set to ``0``
#: (globally, or per call via ``chunk_size=0``) to disable chunking. See
#: ``turbovec._interruptible`` for the full contract.
#:
#: 4096 rows keeps the between-slice Ctrl-C latency in single-digit
#: milliseconds at every supported dim/bit-width while paying the
#: per-slice overhead (snapshot + pool handoff, ~1 ms) a quarter as
#: often as the previous 1000-row default — measured as the difference
#: between 0.11 s and ~0.05 s for a 100k x 768d bulk add. Now that
#: every add chunks (an add never fits a calibration, so slicing is
#: always byte-exact), bulk loads pay this overhead too, and the
#: default has to respect them.
